/*

Bangladesh has n cities, and m roads between them.You can go from one city to another if there exists a path between those two cities.
The goal is to  reach from city 1 to n.
Input -
The first input line has two integers n and m the number of cities and roads. The cities are numbered 1,2,â€¦,n .After that, there are m lines describing the roads. Each line has two integers a and b. There is a road between those cities.A road always connects two different cities, and there is at most one road between any two cities.
Output - Print "YES" if your goal is possible, and "NO" otherwise.
Constraints-
2<=n<=10^5 , 1<=m<=2*10^5 , 1<=a,b<=n
**Write a C++ program for this problem**
