Directed cyclic graoh(DCG) and directed acylic graph(DAG) are both type of directed graph. But they
have significantly differences in terms of their structure and properties. Herer are three key
differences:

1. Cycles vs No Cycles: The most fundamental differences between DCG's and DAG's is the 
presence and absence of cycles. A DCG is a directed graph that contain at least one cycle.
meaning that there is a path that leads back to a vertex itself. in contrast a DAG is a 
directed graph that doesn't have any cycles, ensuring that there is no loop back to vertex.
The absence of cycles in DAG's that makes them particular useful in various applications,
such as representing dependencies or precedence relationship.

2. Reachability and path properties: Due to the presence of the cycles, DCG's exhbits 
different reachibilty or path properties compare to the DAG's. It is possible to have
cyclic paths where revisit vertex multiple times. This cyclic nature can leads to complex
reachibilty patterns, where a vertex can be reacheble from itself or from multiple paths.
in contrast DAG has well defined reachibilty properties.Each vertex in a DAG can only
be reached by following a directed path, and there are no cycles to complicate the reachibilty
relationships.


Topological sorting: Topological sorting is a process of linearly ordering the vertics
of a directed graph such that for every directed edge(u,v), vertex u comes before vertex
v in the ordering. DAGs have useful property called a topological order, which is allows 
for the efficient topological sorting. This properties allows the algorithm to process the
vertics in a systematic manner, considering the dependencies between them. In DCG's the presence of
the cyclic order prevents the existence of a topological order, making topological sorting
impossible.
