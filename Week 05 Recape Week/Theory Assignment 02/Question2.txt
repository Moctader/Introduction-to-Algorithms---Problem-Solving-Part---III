What is Topological Sort?Explain with Example.	

Topological sort is an algorithm used to order the vertics of a directed acylic
graph(DAG)in such a way that for every directed edge (u,v) vertex u comes before
vertex v in the ordering. 

The Topological sort algorithm works by repeatedly selecting a vertex with no incoming
edges and adding it to the sorted order. This process continues untill all
vertics have been include in the ordering or it determined that the graph contains
a cycle.

For  Example: a Topological sorting of the following graph is "5 4 2 3 1 0".
There can be more than one Topological sorting for a graph. Another Topological
sorting of the following graph is "4 5 2 3 1 0". The first vertex in Topological
sorting is always a vertex with an in degree of 0( a vertex with no incoming edges)

            




//Can a topological sort be implemented in a Directed cyclic graph (DCG)?
If so, explain How would you do it?	

No, a topological sort cannot be implemented in a Directed cyclic Graph(DCG).
The main requirement for a topological sort is that the graph must be a directed
acylic Graph(DAG). Meaning it should not contain any cycle.
