In a recursive function, the base case serves as the termination condition that stops
the recursive calls and allows function to returning values. It provides a stopping
point for  the recursion and defines the simplest scenario where the function's logic
can be directly applied without further recursive calls.

The purpose of the base case in a recursive function is to prevent infinite recursion
or a endless loop. withour a base case, the recursive functionwould continue making 
recursive call indifinitely, leading to a stack overflowerror of consuming excussive computional
resources. This is beacuse each recursive calls add new frame to the call stck, and without
a base case to stop the recursion, the call stack would keep growing untill exceeds it's limit.

including a base case ensures that the recursion eventually reaches a point where it stops
and starts unwinding the stack. returning vallues from each recursive call untill the initialize
call is reached. The base casee provides a condition that allows the function to return
a result directly without making further recursive calls.


What is recursion, and how is it different from iteration?	

recursion: recursion is a programming techinque where a function call itself directly or
indirectly.

Iteration: iteration on the other hand is a programming construct that allows repettive 
excutionof a block of code.

Difference between recursion and iteration:

1. control flow: recursion involve dividing a problem into smaller subproblems and
solving them making recursive calls. The control flow jums to different instances of
the same function.In cntrast itertion flows a linear control flow, excuting a same block
of code until a condition met.

2. Function calls: recursion rellies on function calls to solve the problem. with each 
call reducing the problem size. in iteration the code block id excuted repeatedly
within a loop construct, without making additional functions calls.

3. Problem Decomposition: recursion decompose a problem by breaking down it into a small
subproblems, iteration typically doesnot decompose a problem. it repeatedly excute the same
block of code.
