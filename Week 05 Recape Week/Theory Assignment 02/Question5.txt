What is a bipartite graph?        	

A bipartite graph also called a bigraph, is a set of graph vertices decompose into two
disjoint sets such that no two graph vertices within the same set are adjacent.

How can you detect whether a graph is bipartite?	

A bipartite graph is a graph whose vertices can be divided intotwo independent 
sets U, V such that every edge(u,v) either connects a vertex from U to V or a vertex
from V to U. In other words, for every edge (u,v) either u belongs to U and v velongs to v
or u belongs to V or v belongs to U. We can also say that there is no edge that connects
vertices of same set.

A bipartite graph is possible if the graph coloring is possible using two color such that
vertices in a set are colored with same color. Note that it is possible to color a cycle
graph with even cycle using two colors.
